In this project I implemented a model described in the book "Machine Learning for Asset Managers" by Lopez de Prado (2019) called "Nested Clustered Optimisation".  Some alterations to the original model were made and several backtesting techniques were applied in order to test the goodness of HNCO portfolio performance.
